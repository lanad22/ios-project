## Brainstorming ideas

1. Mindful Moments - A wellness app that prompts users randomly throughout the day with brief mindfulness exercises.
   
   - Description: In our fast-paced world, it's easy to go through the entire day without a moment of pause. Mindful Moments would serve as a gentle nudge to take short breaks for mental health. The app would send random notifications during the user's waking hours that invite them to engage in a 30-second to 2-minute mindfulness exercise. These exercises could range from deep breathing to visualizations to gratitude reflections. The app would track the user's progress and adjust the frequency and type of mindfulness exercises based on the user's feedback and engagement levels.

2. Fresh Fare Finder - An app for locating and purchasing surplus food from local retailers and restaurants at a discounted price.
   
   - Description: This app would combat food waste by connecting consumers with local businesses that have surplus food items at the end of the day. Retailers and restaurants would list their surplus items on the app at a discounted price. Users can browse for deals near them, purchase directly through the app, and pick up their food, helping businesses reduce waste and offering consumers lower prices. The app could also feature a social component, allowing users to share their eco-friendly purchases and savings with friends.

3. Skill Swap - A community-based skill exchange app where users can barter their expertise or services in exchange for someone else's.
   
   - Description: Skill Swap would be a platform for exchanging services without money changing hands. For example, a user proficient in graphic design could offer to create a logo for another user who, in turn, could provide gardening services. The app would use a credit system to ensure fairness; credits are earned by providing a service and can be spent on acquiring a service. Users can set up profiles listing their skills, availability, and the types of services they’re interested in receiving. The app would also feature reviews and endorsements to build trust within the community.

4. What’s in Your Fridge App
    - Descrition: This is a kitchen management and meal planning app that helps reduce food waste while making cooking more accessible. Users input or scan the items in their fridge or pantry, and the app suggests recipes that can be made with those ingredients. It's designed for anyone looking to make meal planning simpler and reduce the number of times they have to run to the grocery store.

## Evaluate and Categorize

#### 1. Mobile:
- **Uniqueness**: This app is distinctly mobile as it would use location services to find nearby deals, camera functionality for businesses to quickly upload images of their surplus food, and push notifications to alert users of time-sensitive deals. Real-time capabilities are crucial, as the availability of discounted items is constantly changing.

#### 2. Story:
- **Compelling Narrative**: Fresh Fare Finder tells a story of sustainability and community support. It's not just about getting food for less; it's about reducing food waste and supporting local businesses. This narrative is very appealing in a society that is becoming increasingly conscious of food waste.
